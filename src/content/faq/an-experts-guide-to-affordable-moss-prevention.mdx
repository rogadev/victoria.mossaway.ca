# The Ultimate Guide to Winning the Battle Against Roof Moss (Without Breaking the Bank!)

Living on the west coast means dealing with roof moss. But don't worry, we're here to help you tackle this issue affordably, effectively, and consistently. Let's dive into common misconceptions about moss removal and reveal the best long-term solution for your roof.

## Debunking Common Moss Removal Myths

You may have come across various methods to combat roof moss, but not all solutions are as effective as they claim. We'll explore some popular but inefficient options.

### Chemical Treatments

Though chemicals like zinc and copper sulfides can kill existing moss, they don't provide long-lasting results. Moreover, these chemicals are harmful to the environment and may even be illegal in some areas. MossAway exclusively uses eco-friendly solutions for moss, algae, and lichen treatment.

### Roof Sealants

Applying sealants to your shingles won't prevent moss growth. Instead, it can hinder your roof's ability to breathe, leading to other issues. Roof sealants are an expensive gamble that doesn't pay off in the long run.

### Zinc Strips

Zinc strips have been marketed as a solution to keep moss at bay. However, our extensive experience shows that they're ineffective, especially on the west coast.

## The Real Solution: Consistent and Affordable Moss Prevention

To keep your roof moss-free, tackle the issue early and regularly with a preventative maintenance plan.
