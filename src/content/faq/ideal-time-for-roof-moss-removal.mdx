As a leading exterior cleaning company, MossAway has been delivering award-winning roof moss removal and treatment services for years. Despite our extensive experience, we often encounter varying opinions about the ideal time for roof moss removal. In this article, we'll clear up some myths and misconceptions by outlining the pros and cons of each season for roof moss removal.

## Spring Season: A Fresh Start

Spring typically signals the start of the roof moss removal season. Warmer weather and fewer rainy days make it an opportune time to schedule your service. However, the official start varies each year, as rain and weather conditions influence the ideal scheduling for your service.

## Summer Season: The Perfect Time

Summer is arguably the best time of year to get roof moss removal and treatment services done on your home or business. The hot, dry weather helps moss crumble away easily, promoting better roof preservation. Since summer is the busiest season for roof moss removal, we recommend booking early.

## Fall Season: Catch It Before Winter

Fall on Vancouver Island is typically still quite hot and dry, making roof moss removal and treatment ideal for most of the season. However, similar to spring, unpredictable wet weather can occur towards the last few weeks of fall. If you've identified a moss problem on your roof, act promptly to avoid worsening issues during the wet winter months.

## Off Season: A Time to Rest

Winter is a challenging season for roof moss removal, as moss growth tends to be vigorous during this time. Removing moss in winter can add unnecessary stress and wear to your roof, and scheduling services can be difficult. MossAway has an official off-season, allowing us to prepare for another busy spring. While other companies might offer services during the winter, we recommend waiting for more suitable conditions.

Ultimately, it's crucial to find a trustworthy business for your roof moss removal needs. MossAway adheres to WorkSafeBC regulations, and our exceptional services have earned us a stellar reputation throughout Greater Victoria.
