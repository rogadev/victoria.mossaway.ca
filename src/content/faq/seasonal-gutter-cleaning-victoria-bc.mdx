## Why is it important to clean my gutters every fall?

When your gutters are clogged up with leaves and debris, they don't drain well under wet winter conditions. If your gutters are holding water when a cold snap hits, the water freezes and expands, which can cause serious damage to your gutter system. Additionally, in heavy rains, debris flowing down your downspout can enter your perimeter drain, causing blockages in the perimeter drainage system.

Getting your gutters cleaned every fall to remove a buildup of debris allows your system to function properly.

## Safer Gutter Cleaning with MossAway

MossAway uses a high-powered gutter vacuum system to minimize the use of ropes, anchors, and ladders. A professional company, accredited with WorkSafeBC, will always rope & harness or use standoffs on their ladder systems. Working from the ground with our vacuum system means the team typically won't need to install roof anchors and oftentimes won't even need to ladder up to clean your system. Gutter vacs also tend to do a better job at cleaning small particulate than hand-scooping alone.
